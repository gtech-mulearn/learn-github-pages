# How to Host an HTML File on GitHub Pages

This guide will walk you through the process of forking a repository containing an HTML file and then hosting it using GitHub Pages.

## Prerequisites:
- A GitHub account. If you don't have one, [sign up](https://github.com/join) for free.

## Steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository
- Navigate to the repository you wish to fork on GitHub.
- Click on the 'Fork' button at the top right corner of the page. This will create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

### 2. Set up GitHub Pages
- Navigate to your forked repository on the GitHub website.
- Go to the 'Settings' tab, located at the top-right corner of the page.
- Scroll down to the 'Pages' section.
- Under 'Branch', select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (change `None` to `main`).
- Click 'Save'.
- Wait a few minutes for your page to be deployed.

### 3. Access Your Hosted HTML File
- Refresh the page and you will find a link to your hosted page at the top.
- After configuring GitHub Pages, GitHub will provide you with a link to your live site. It usually looks something like: `https://yourusername.github.io/forked-repo-name/`

### 4. Editing Files
- Since you have already hosted your website via GitHub pages, let's edit it and view it live.
- For this open the `/index.html` file and edit the text **Github Pages** in line number 96 to **Github Page by [Your Name]**.
- Once you have edited the file, click on the commit changes button on the top right of the editor to commit your changes.
- Enter a commit message and click commit changes once again to confirm your changes.
- Now, within a few minutes, your edit will be visible on the website.


### Conclusion
That's it! You have successfully forked a repository and hosted an HTML file using GitHub Pages without cloning locally. Enjoy your live site!
